1NNN   | JMP       | Jumps to location NNN.
2NNN   | CALL      | Calls subroutine at NNN by pushing address of the next
       |           | instruction on the stack and setting the PC to the
       |           | address contained in the instruction.
3XNN   | SKIP.EQ   | Skips the next instruction if VX equals NN.
4XNN   | SKIP.NE   | Skips the next instruction if VX does not equal NN.
5XY0   | SKIP.EQ   | SKips the next instruction if VX equals VY.
6XNN   | MVI       | Sets VX to NN.
7XNN   | ADI       | Adds NN to VX (carry flag not changed).
8XY0   | MOV.      | Sets VX to the value of VY.
8XY1   | OR.       | Logical OR VX with VY.
8XY2   | AND.      | Logical AND VX with VY.
8XY3   | XOR.      | Logical XOR VX with VY.
8XY4   | ADD.      | Add VY to VX.
8XY5   | SUB.      | Subtract VY from VX. 
8X06   | SHR.      | Stores the LSB of VX in VF and shifts VX to the right by 1.
8XY7   | SUBB.     | Subtract VX from VY.
8X0E   | SHL.      | Stores the MSB of VX in VF and shifts VX to the left by 1.
9XY0   | SKIP.NE   | Skips the next instruction if VX does not equal VY.
ANNN   | MVI       | Set I to NNN.
BNNN   | JMP       | Jumps to location NNN plus V0.
CXNN   | RNDMSK    | Get random byte and logical OR with VX.
DXYN   | SPRITE    | Draws a sprite at coordinate (VX, VY) that has a width of
       |           | 8 pixels and a height of N pixels.
EX9E   | SKIPKEY.Y | Skips the next instruction if key stored in VX is pressed.
EXA1   | SKIPKEY.N | Skips the next instruction if key stored in VX is not pressed.
FX07   | MOV       | Sets VX to the value of the delay timer.
FX0A   | KEY       | A key press is awaited and then stored in VX.
FX15   | MOV       | Sets the delay timer to VX.
FX18   | MOV       | Sets the sound timer to VX.
FX1E   | ADI       | Adds VX to I.
FX29   | SPRITECHAR| Sets I to location of sprite for the characterin VX.
FX33   | MOVBCD    | Stores 3 digit decimal equivalent of VX.
FX55   | MOVM      | Store V0 through VX at I.
FX65   | MOVM      | Load V0 through VX at I
